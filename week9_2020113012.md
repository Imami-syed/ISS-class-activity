Prime = " On input p :
1. If p is even , accept if p = 2 ; otherwise , reject.
2. Select a<sub>1</sub>, .... a<sub>k</sub> randomly in Z<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup>
3. For each i from 1 to k :
4.  Compute a <sub>i</sub><sup>p-1</sup> mod p and reject if different from 1 
5. let p-1 = st where s is odd and t = 2 <sup>h</sup> is a power of 2
6. Compute the sequence a<sub>i</sub><sup>s.2<sup>0</sup></sup>, a<sub>i</sub><sup>s.2<sup>1</sup></sup>, a<sub>i</sub><sup>s.2<sup>2</sup></sup>, ... a<sub>i</sub><sup>s.2<sup>h</sup></sup> modulo p
7. If some element of this sequence is not 1 , find the last element that is not 1 and reject if the element is not -1
8. All tests have passed at this point, so accept."

If p is an odd prime number , Pr[PRIME accepts p ] = 1<br>
**Proof** : We first show that if  p is prime, no witness exist and so no branch of the algorithm rejects . If a were a stage 4 witness , (a<sup>p-1</sup> mod p) not equals to  1 and Fermat's little theorem implies that p is composite . If a were a stage 7 witness, some b exists in Z<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup>, where

<br><br>

Therefore <br><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;b^2&space;-&space;1&space;\equiv&space;0\;&space;(mod&space;\;&space;p)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} b^2 - 1 \equiv 0\; (mod \; p)}" /><br>. Factoring b<sup>2</sup>-1 yeilds
<br><br><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;(b&space;-&space;1)(b&space;&plus;&space;1)&space;\equiv&space;0\;&space;(mod&space;\;&space;p)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} (b - 1)(b + 1) \equiv 0\; (mod \; p)}" />,<br><br>
which implies that <br><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;(b&space;-&space;1)(b&space;&plus;&space;1)&space;=&space;cp}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} (b - 1)(b + 1) = cp}" /><br>
for some positive integer c. Because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;b&space;\not\equiv&space;\pm&space;1&space;(mod&space;\;p)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} b \not\equiv \pm 1 (mod \;p)}" />, both b-1 and b+1 are strictly between 0 and p . Therefore p is composite because a mutliple of a prime number cannot be expresed as a product of numbers that are smaller than it is <br>
If p is an odd composite number, Pr[PRIME accepts p] <= 2 <sup>-k</sup>.<br>

**Proof** :  We show that , if p is an odd composite number and a is selected randomly in Z<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup>,
<br><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;Pr[a&space;\;is&space;\;a&space;\;witness]&space;\geq&space;1/2}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} Pr[a \;is \;a \;witness] \geq 1/2}" />
<br><br>
by demonstrating that at least as many witnesses as non witnesses exist in Z<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup>, We do so by finding a unique witness for each nonwitness.<br>
In every nonwitness, the sequence computed in stage 6 is either all 1s or contains -1 at some position, followed by 1s. For example, 1 itself is a nonwitness of the first kind and -1 is a nonwitness of the second kind bexause s is odd and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;(-1)^{s.2^0}&space;\equiv&space;-1}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} (-1)^{s.2^0} \equiv -1}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;(-1)^{s.2^1}&space;\equiv&space;1}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} (-1)^{s.2^1} \equiv 1}" />.<br>
Among all nonwitness of the second kind, find a nonwitness for which the -1 appears in the largest position in the sequence, where the sequnce positions are numbered starting at 0. Hence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;h^{s.2^j}&space;\equiv&space;-1\;(mod\;p)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} h^{s.2^j} \equiv -1\;(mod\;p)}" /><br><br>

But p is composite, either p is the power of a prime or we can write p as the prodct of q and r , two numbers are relatively prime. We consider the latter case first . THe chinese remainder theorem implies that some number t exists in Z<sub>p</sub> whereby
<br><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}t\equiv&space;h\;(mod\;p)\;&space;and}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow}t\equiv h\;(mod\;p)\; and}" />
<br><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}t\equiv&space;1\;(mod\;r)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow}t\equiv 1\;(mod\;r)}" />
<br><br>
Therefore
<br><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;t^{s.2^j}&space;\equiv&space;-1\;(mod\;q)&space;\;&space;and}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} t^{s.2^j} \equiv -1\;(mod\;q) \; and}" />
<br><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;t^{s.2^j}&space;\equiv&space;1\;(mod&space;\;r)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} t^{s.2^j} \equiv 1\;(mod \;r)}" />
<br><br>
hence t is a witness because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;t^{s.2^j}&space;\not\equiv&space;\pm1\;(mod&space;\;p)\;but\;t^{s.2^{j&plus;1}}&space;\equiv&space;1\;(mod&space;\;p)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} t^{s.2^j} \not\equiv \pm1\;(mod \;p)\;but\;t^{s.2^{j+1}} \equiv 1\;(mod \;p)}" /><br>

Now that we have one witness , we can get many more. We prove that dt mod p is a unique witness for each nonwitness d by making two observations.<br>
Find , <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;d^{s.2^j}&space;\equiv&space;\pm1\;(mod&space;\;p)\;and\;d^{s.2^{j&plus;1}}&space;\not\equiv&space;\pm1\;and&space;\;(dt)^{s.2^{j&plus;1}}&space;\equiv&space;1\;(mod&space;\;p)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} d^{s.2^j} \equiv \pm1\;(mod \;p)\;and\;d^{s.2^{j+1}} \not\equiv \pm1\;and \;(dt)^{s.2^{j+1}} \equiv 1\;(mod \;p)}" /> owing to the way j was chosen. Therefore dt mod p is a witness because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;(dt)^{s.2^j}&space;\not\equiv&space;\pm1&space;\;and&space;(dt)^{s.2^{j&plus;1}}&space;\equiv&space;1\;&space;(mod&space;\;p)}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} (dt)^{s.2^j} \not\equiv \pm1 \;and (dt)^{s.2^{j+1}} \equiv 1\; (mod \;p)}" /><br>.
Second if d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> are distinct nonwitness , d<sub>1</sub>t mod p not equals to d<sub>1</sub>t mod p. The reason is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;t^{s.2^{j&plus;1}}&space;\;mod\;p=1}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} t^{s.2^{j+1}} \;mod\;p=1}" /> . Hence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;t.t^{s.2^{j&plus;1}&space;-&space;1}&space;\;mod\;p=1}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} t.t^{s.2^{j+1} - 1} \;mod\;p=1}" />. Therefore , if td<sub>1</sub>t mod p = td<sub>2</sub>t mod p, then
<br>
<br><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;d_1&space;=&space;t.t^{s.2^{j&plus;1}&space;-&space;1}&space;d_1\;mod\;p=t.t^{s.2^{j&plus;1}&space;-&space;1}&space;d_2\;mod\;p&space;=&space;d_2}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} d_1 = t.t^{s.2^{j+1} - 1} d_1\;mod\;p=t.t^{s.2^{j+1} - 1} d_2\;mod\;p = d_2}" />
<br><br>
Thus the number of witnesses mst be as large as the number of nonwitnesses, and we have completed the analysis for the case where p is not a prime power.<br>
For the Prime power case, we have p = q<sup>e</sup> where q is prime and e > 1 . Let t = 1 + q<sup>e-1</sup> . Expanding t<sup>p</sup> using the binomial theorem we obtain<br><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;t^{p}=(1&plus;q^{e-1})^p&space;=&space;1&space;&plus;&space;p.q^{e-1}&space;&plus;&space;multiples&space;\;of\;&space;higher&space;\;powers&space;\;of&space;\;q^{e-1}}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} t^{p}=(1+q^{e-1})^p = 1 + p.q^{e-1} + multiples \;of\; higher \;powers \;of \;q^{e-1}}" />
<br><br> 
which is equivalent to 1 mod p . Hence  t is a stage 4 witness because ,if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;t^{p-1}\equiv&space;1\;&space;mod\;&space;p&space;}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} t^{p-1}\equiv 1\; mod\; p }" /> then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;t^p\equiv&space;t\not\equiv&space;1\;&space;mod\;&space;p&space;}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} t^p\equiv t\not\equiv 1\; mod\; p }" /> As in the previous case, we use this one witness to get many others. If d is a nonwitness, we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;d^{p-1}\equiv&space;1\;&space;mod\;&space;p&space;}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} d^{p-1}\equiv 1\; mod\; p }" /> but then dt mod p is a witness. Moreover, if d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> are distinct nonwitnesses, then d<sub>1</sub> t mod p not equals to  d<sub>2</sub> t mod p . Otherwise
<br><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{80}&space;\fn_phv&space;\huge&space;{\color{Yellow}&space;d_1&space;=&space;d_1.t.t^{p-1}&space;\;&space;mod\;&space;p&space;=&space;d_2.t.t^{p-1}&space;\;&space;mod\;&space;p&space;=&space;d_2}" title="\huge {\color{Yellow} d_1 = d_1.t.t^{p-1} \; mod\; p = d_2.t.t^{p-1} \; mod\; p = d_2}" />
<br><br>
Thus the number of witnesses must be as large as the number of nonwitnesses, and the proof is complete<br><br>

- A verifier for a language A is an algorithm V, where A={w|V accepts < w,c > for some string c}. 
- A language A is polynomially verifiable if it has a polynomial time verifier.

- NP is the class of languages that have polynomial time verifiers.
- NP stands for “nondeterministic polynomial time,” a term going back to the roots of complexity theory.
- It means that a solution to any search problem can be found
and verified in polynomial time by a special (and quite unrealistic) sort of algorithm, called a nondeterministic algorithm. Such an algorithm has the power of guessing correctly at every step.
- The original definition of NP was not as a class of search problems, but as a class of decision problems: algorithmic questions that can be answered by yes or no.

----

- “Is there a truth assignment that satisfies this Boolean formula?” But this too reflects a historical reality: At the time the theory of NP-completeness was being developed researchers in the theory of computation were interested in formal languages, a domain in which such decision problems are of central importance.
- CLIQUE = {< G,k>|G is an undirected graph with a k-clique}.<br />
PROOF: The following is a verifier V for CLIQUE.<br />
V= "On input << G,k>,c>:<br />
1. Test whether c is a set of k nodes in G.
2. Test whether G contains all edges connecting nodes in c.
3. If both pass, accept; otherwise, reject."

{< S,t>|S={x1,x2,......xk} and for some {y1,y2,...,yl} subset of {x1,x2,....,xk}, we have Σyi=t

----

#### Proof
The following is a verifier V for SUBSET-SUM. <br />
V= "On input << S,t>,c>: <br />
1. Test whether c is a collection of numbers that sum to t.
2. Test whether S contains all the numbers in c.
3. If both pass, accept; otherwise, reject."

- Observe that the complements of these sets, CLIQUE and SUBSET-SUM are not obviously members of NP. Verifying that something is not present seems to be more difficult than verifying that it is present. We make a seperate complexity class, called as coNP, which contains the languages that are complements of languages in NP. We don't know whether coNP is different from NP.

- P = the class of languages for which membership can be decided quickly.
- P must stand for “polynomial.”
- NP = the class of languages for which membership can be verified quickly.
- So if P = NP, there would be an efficient method to prove any theorem.
- All in all, there are a variety of reasons why it is widely believed that P not euqal to NP.

- Language A is polynomial time mapping reducible, to language B, written A  ≤p B, if a polynomial time computable function <br />
f:Σ* -> Σ* exists, where for every w, w ∈ A --> f(w) ∈ B.<br />
The function f is called the polynomial time reduction of A and B.
- If A  ≤p B and B ∈ P, then A ∈ P.<br />
" On input w: <br />
1. Compute f(w).
2. Run M on input f(w) and output whatever M outputs."

- 3SAT is polynomial time reducible to CLIQUE. where <br />
3SAT = {< ∅>|∅ is a satisfiable 3cnf-formula}.

----

#### Proof:
- In 3 SAT the input is a set of clauses, each with three or fewer literals, for example <br />
(x ∨ y ∨ z) (x ∨ y ∨ z) (x ∨ y ∨ z) (x ∨ y),and the aim is to find a satisfying truth assignment.
- In INDEPENDENT SET the input is a graph and a number g, and the problem is to find a set of g pairwise non-adjacent vertices.
- To form a satisfying truth assignment we must pick one literal from each clause and give it the value true.

- The Cook–Levin theorem, also known as Cook's theorem, states that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete. That is, it is in NP, and any problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine to the Boolean satisfiability problem.
- SAT is NP-complete.
